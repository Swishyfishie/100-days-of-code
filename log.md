##### (delete me or comment me out)

<!--**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

<!--**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 17/04/2019

**Today's progress**: Read JavaScript documentation. Followed Brad Traversy's JavaScript course and today's lesson was Constructors and 'this' keyword. Learned more about object oriented programming.

**Thoughts** : This is not my first day of this challenge, It should've been day 60 but I missed a day of coding and even though the rules say that it doesn't mean that I failed the challenge, I wanted to start fresh so I can commit to gitHub everyday.
