<!--**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

<!--**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 17/04/2019

**Today's progress**: Read JavaScript documentation. Followed Brad Traversy's JavaScript course and today's lesson was Constructors and 'this' keyword. Learned more about object oriented programming.

**Thoughts** : This is not my first day of this challenge, It should've been day 60 but I missed a day of coding and even though the rules say that it doesn't mean that I failed the challenge, I wanted to start fresh so I can commit to gitHub everyday.

### Day 2: 18/04/2019

**Today's progress and thoughts**: Haven't worked on JavaScript today. Attempted a few codewars challenges but without much success. I've looked for the solutions online and learnt a few ways of solving problems. Got into FrontEnd Masters' free course and that was quite nice. I feel like I'm going to subscribe to them as soon as I finish with Traversy Media's JavaScript course. Also did a small basic project just to brush up my html and css skills.

### Day 3: 19/04/2019

**Today's progress and thoughts**: Today I followed Front End Masters couses. I followed examples from Traversy Media's course and worked in console. No projects today. 

### Day 4: 20/04/2019

**Today's progress and thoughts**: I have learnt about prototypes in JS and played a bit with bootstrap. Will document myself more. Questions like "When will I understand?" "Am I doing this wrong?" "Is this for me?" are permanent in one's head.The trick is to let them go as you'd let any kind of doubt. As long as I'm doing something, there's only progress, no matter how fast.
